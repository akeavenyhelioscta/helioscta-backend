## Business Purpose

Final, verified real-time settlement prices used for official P&L calculation and reconciliation. These replace unverified prices once PJM completes its settlement process.

## Downstream

- dbt: `pjm_cleaned.pjm_lmps_rt_hourly`, `pjm_cleaned.pjm_lmps_hourly`

## Known Caveats

- ~60-day delay is normal and expected
- Not useful for intraday decision-making; use unverified LMPs for that
