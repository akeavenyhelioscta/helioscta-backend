{% docs col_forecast_execution_datetime %}
Timestamp (EPT) when the forecast was issued by Meteologica. Converted from UTC `issue_date`
in the raw table. Used as the ranking key — `forecast_rank = 1` corresponds to the most
recent `forecast_execution_datetime` for a given forecast date.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_forecast_execution_date %}
Date portion (EPT) of `forecast_execution_datetime`. Useful for filtering to forecasts
issued on a specific day.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_forecast_datetime %}
Combined forecast target timestamp: `forecast_date + (hour_ending - 1) hours`. Represents
the **start** of the hour-ending period in EPT. For example, hour_ending = 1 on 2026-03-04
yields `2026-03-04 00:00:00`.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_forecast_date %}
The date being forecasted, in Eastern Prevailing Time (EPT). Derived from
`forecast_period_start` converted from UTC to America/New_York.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_meteologica_hour_ending %}
Hour ending in Eastern Prevailing Time (1-24). Derived from `forecast_period_start` converted
from UTC to EPT: `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM ... AT TIME ZONE 'America/New_York') + 1`.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_date_utc %}
Forecast target date in UTC. The raw `forecast_period_start` date before timezone conversion.
Retained for debugging and cross-referencing with the Meteologica API.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_hour_ending_utc %}
Hour ending in UTC (1-24). The raw hour from `forecast_period_start` before timezone conversion.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_meteologica_forecast_rank %}
Recency rank of the forecast vintage. `1` = most recent forecast for a given target date.
Computed via `DENSE_RANK()` ordered by `forecast_execution_datetime DESC`, so all hours
within the same vintage share the same rank. No completeness filter is applied — partial
vintages are included.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_forecast_load_mw %}
Forecasted demand/load in MW from Meteologica's weather-driven demand model.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_forecast_generation_mw %}
Forecasted generation in MW from Meteologica's weather-driven generation model.
Covers solar, wind, and hydro sources.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_forecast_da_price %}
Forecasted day-ahead electricity price in $/MWh from Meteologica's price model.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_generation_source %}
Generation fuel/technology type. One of: **solar** (PV), **wind**, or **hydro**.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_meteologica_region %}
PJM region for demand and generation forecasts. Macro regions: **RTO**, **MIDATL**,
**WEST**, **SOUTH**.

Demand forecasts include 32 utility-level sub-regions across all three macro regions
(e.g., MIDATL_AE, MIDATL_DPL, SOUTH_DOM, WEST_AEP, WEST_ATSI, WEST_EKPC).

Wind generation forecasts include 8 utility-level sub-regions:
MIDATL_AE, MIDATL_PL, MIDATL_PN, SOUTH_DOM, WEST_AEP, WEST_AP, WEST_ATSI, WEST_CE.
{% enddocs %}

{% docs col_meteologica_hub %}
PJM pricing hub for DA price forecasts. **SYSTEM** is the system-wide price.
Hub nodes: AEP DAYTON, AEP GEN, ATSI GEN, CHICAGO GEN, CHICAGO, DOMINION, EASTERN,
NEW JERSEY, N ILLINOIS, OHIO, WESTERN, WEST INT.
