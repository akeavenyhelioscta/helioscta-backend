{% docs pjm_source %}

Raw PJM data ingested via **PJM Data Miner 2** and direct PJM API scrapes.

into Azure PostgreSQL.

**Included datasets:**
- Hourly load (metered, preliminary, instantaneous)
- Day-ahead demand bids (cleared load)
- Day-ahead and real-time LMPs (verified and unverified)
- 7-day load forecast
