## Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs)

LMP models provide day-ahead, real-time, and DA-RT spread pricing by hub.

### Data Sources
- **DA LMPs** — PJM Data Miner 2 `da_hrl_lmps` (next-day morning)
- **RT verified LMPs** — PJM `rt_settlements_verified_hourly_lmps` (~60 day lag)
- **RT unverified LMPs** — PJM `rt_unverified_hourly_lmps` (same-day)

### Key Transformations
- RT hourly model merges verified and unverified sources, **preferring verified** via
  `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (... ORDER BY verified DESC)` deduplication
- **DART spread** = DA LMP - RT LMP, computed per hour/hub
- Three market types (DA, RT, DART) are UNION'd into a single table

### Models

| Model | Grain | Materialization |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| `staging_v1_pjm_lmps_hourly` | date × hour_ending × hub × market | ephemeral |
| `staging_v1_pjm_lmps_rt_hourly` | date × hour_ending × hub | ephemeral |
| `staging_v1_pjm_lmps_daily` | date × hub × period × market | ephemeral |

### Price Components
Each LMP is decomposed into: **total**, **system energy price**, **congestion price**, **marginal loss price**.

{% docs pjm_load_da %}

## Day-Ahead Load

Day-ahead cleared load from PJM demand bids, broken down by region.

### Data Source
- PJM Data Miner 2 `hrl_dmd_bids` — hourly day-ahead demand bids by load area

### Key Transformations
- Load areas are mapped to parent regions (RTO, MIDATL, WEST) via the region mapping utility
- **SOUTH is computed as RTO - MIDATL - WEST** using conditional aggregation
- Daily models aggregate hourly data into **flat**, **peak**, **onpeak**, and **offpeak** periods

### Models

| Model | Grain |
|-------|-------|
| `staging_v1_pjm_load_da_hourly` | date × hour_ending × region |
| `staging_v1_pjm_load_da_daily` | date × region × period |

{% enddocs %}


{% docs pjm_load_rt %}

## Real-Time Load

Three tiers of real-time load data, each with different latency and accuracy:

| Tier | Source | Lag | Use Case |
|------|--------|-----|----------|
| **Instantaneous** | 5-min API, averaged to hourly | ~5 min | Live monitoring |
| **Preliminary** | PJM Data Miner 2 | ~1 hour | Same-day analysis |
| **Metered (actual)** | PJM Data Miner 2 | ~2 days | Settlement, backtesting |

### Key Transformations
- All tiers share the same regional breakdown: RTO, MIDATL, WEST, SOUTH
- SOUTH is computed as RTO - MIDATL - WEST (same as DA load)
- Daily models use **holiday-aware OnPeak/OffPeak** definitions (NERC holidays treated as off-peak)
- Peak hours: HE08–HE23 on weekdays excluding NERC holidays

### Models

| Model | Grain |
|-------|-------|
| `staging_v1_pjm_load_rt_metered_hourly` | date × hour_ending × region |
| `staging_v1_pjm_load_rt_metered_daily` | date × region × period |
| `staging_v1_pjm_load_rt_prelim_hourly` | date × hour_ending × region |
| `staging_v1_pjm_load_rt_prelim_daily` | date × region × period |
| `staging_v1_pjm_load_rt_instantaneous_hourly` | date × hour_ending × region |

{% enddocs %}


{% docs pjm_load_forecast %}

## Load Forecast

7-day hourly load forecasts from both PJM API and GridStatus. Multiple forecast
revisions are issued per day; models retain all revisions ranked by recency.

### Data Sources
- **PJM API** — `seven_day_load_forecast_v1_2025_08_13`
- **GridStatus** — `pjm_load_forecast` (regions pre-normalized)

### Key Transformations
- Only **complete forecasts** are kept (all 24 hours × all regions present)
- `forecast_rank = 1` is the most recent forecast for a given `forecast_date`
- Daily models aggregate to holiday-aware OnPeak/OffPeak periods

### Models

| Model | Grain |
|-------|-------|
| `staging_v1_pjm_load_forecast_hourly` | forecast_rank × forecast_date × hour_ending × region |
| `staging_v1_pjm_load_forecast_daily` | forecast_rank × forecast_date × region × period |
| `staging_v1_gridstatus_pjm_load_forecast_hourly` | forecast_rank × forecast_date × hour_ending × region |

{% enddocs %}


{% docs pjm_fuel_mix %}

## Fuel Mix

Hourly and daily generation by fuel type across the PJM RTO footprint.

### Data Source
- GridStatus `pjm_fuel_mix_hourly`

### Fuel Types
`coal`, `gas`, `hydro`, `multiple_fuels`, `nuclear`, `oil`, `solar`, `storage`, `wind`, `other`, `other_renewables`

### Computed Aggregates
- **total** — sum of all fuel types
- **thermal** — coal + gas + oil + nuclear + multiple_fuels
- **renewables** — solar + wind + hydro + other_renewables
- **gas_pct_thermal** / **coal_pct_thermal** — fuel share within thermal generation

### Models

| Model | Grain |
|-------|-------|
| `staging_v1_pjm_fuel_mix_hourly` | date × hour_ending |
| `staging_v1_pjm_fuel_mix_daily` | date × period |
